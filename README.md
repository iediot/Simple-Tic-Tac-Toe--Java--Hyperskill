Finalised the project, and should probably add a description for the fifth and final version of the code, so here it is:
The code is a simple 2 player Tic Tac Toe, it was very simple to do, the code should be very readable as it was done very
easily and in a clean way. A big part of the code was reused from previous stages, as the tasks were very similar. 
This project is a "Hard" one on Hyperskill, the site where it originates from.
A simple, clean and fun project made in a very short amount of time.

Unfinalised project, here are stages 2 and 3, the functionality of the whole program is still lacking as of stage 3, but that will be improved shortly.
Update 1: added a file that contains stages 2, 3 and 4;
I know that stages 2 and 3 were posted before but I was too lazy to make it a separate file and I need the file to be clean for the fifth and last stage.
